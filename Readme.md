This is repository is a set of examples used in my talk _"Functional Programming in Java - When, why and how?"_.

All examples assume JDK 11 and Maven 3.x.

## How to use this project

This project consists of a number of branches.
On each branch, there is a `next.sh` script, which will stash all unsaved changes and will then switch to the next 
branch in order; this will always be in the form `task/x` followed by `solutions/x` and then the next `task/y` branch.
