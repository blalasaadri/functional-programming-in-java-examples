        "summary": "It is widely accepted that AI is the future of testing. However, because a fault lies in the eye of the beholder, it is pretty unclear _how_ to apply AI to testing—called the Oracle problem.\r\n\r\nThere are literally thousands of UI test automation tools. But due to high efforts for creation and maintenance, together with the brittleness and unreliability of the resulting tests, testing often remains a manual task (confirming the testing pyramid). Meanwhile Software testing accounts for 30%-40% of the budget of a typical software project.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a way to circumvent the oracle problem and use AI to not only find technical errors (i.e. crashes), but to generate tests for business functionality—autonomous automation. See how AI can be trained to generate tests that are optimized towards several goals and are even better than manually created ones.\r\n\r\nVisit the future of testing and see how AI can help us create better software!"
