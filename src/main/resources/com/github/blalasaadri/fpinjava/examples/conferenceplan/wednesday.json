These changes aim to keep Java vibrant in an ever-changing world of competing platforms and new styles of application deployment, whether to the cloud or to app stores. They are disruptive, but they’re not as scary as you may think, and many developers have already adjusted to them."

MicroProfile JWT designed a mechanism to propagate the security state from clients to services or event services to services by using security tokens. This session will give you a quick overview on the MicroProfile JWT design, followed by a live demo of microservices communication by passing on the JSON web token, running on Open Liberty (https://openliberty.io/). Come to this session to understand the technology and learn how to use it."

        "summary": "Micro-services are the new black; everyone is using them. Alas, when your system is composed of many micro-services, testing becomes more challenging. The straight-forward approach for E2E testing no longer suffices and for integration tests it doesn’t even exist. A better way to test in this kind of an environment would be to work with a test kit of the micro-service you are interacting with.\r\nBy the end of this talk, you will learn how to create a test-kit that covers your micro-service. Testing this way will grant you a much higher level of confidence, and will portray a more accurate picture of your assumptions vs. reality. Overall it will make any integration between micro-services easier, thus benefit your colleagues and make your company progress faster."

The solution of the game is so hard (5**1000) that we don't know any human that passed it without help.\r\n\r\nThe challenge is design an AI that play and solve the game. We used Reinforcement Learning as the main Deep Learning.\r\n\r\nBuilding a project like this take a lots of big challenges like: lots of resources for training the model (GPUs/TPUs), executing games , storing lots of information, analyzing data,  etc. \r\n\r\nWhen you need to afford it, you will need a lot of products/tools no just AI tools like tensorflow/keras. We will show you how Google Cloud is your perfect ally and you will have the right tools to leverage a near impossible problem like this one.  \r\n"
