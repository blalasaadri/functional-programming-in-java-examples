        "lang": "en",
        "summary": "Most APIs built today are considered REST APIs these days, when in fact they merely exchange data via HTTP and JSON. At the same time, systems almost never act autonomously but rather live alongside others. In that context, being able to evolve an API becomes a crucial aspect in its design and the only knee-jerk, but often problematic reaction usually is: versioning.\r\n\r\nThe talk takes a step back and looks at the architectural context APIs live in and outlines the drawbacks that result from ignoring crucial parts of REST. It discusses internal VS. external APIs, whether that distinction is useful in the first place, the impact of Domain-Driven Design and how to design and specify APIs and their clients to optimize for evolvability so that changes in an API don’t break clients."

Some serious, some less so, some good, some undeniably indifferent to bad to plain stupid.\r\n\r\nBut out of all of this I wondered what should REALLY drive our development? In this lightning trip around the alphabet of absurdity I will tell you the one guiding principal that we should all stick to when deciding what should drive our development."

B-threads communicate with each other using a synchronized, event-based protocol.

But most importantly, systems written in BP are *verifiable*. That is - it is possible to *formally prove they contain no bugs*.\r\n\r\nThe ability to formally verify critical parts of a system, rather than merely testing them, can transform the way we create software.

        "summary": "Most of the Java applications are written in Java 8 nowadays and people are looking around to upgrade to Java 11 or even migrating to Kotlin.  Both are promoted as the new way to go and both have their own strengths. Upgrading to Java 11 might be an obvious next safe step to do and probably the most used frameworks will be Java 11 compliant soon. But what if you could migrate to Kotlin with the same effort? This would bring you additional advantages like: data class, very concise list manipulations, extension functions and even more to get you’re code more readable and maintainable.\r\nConsidering the Kotlin migration, the first questions that pop up are: What are the wise steps to take and where to start? Some experiences and thoughts answering these questions will be shared during this live coding session."

You’ve updated to the latest Android Plugin, but you’re still waiting more than you like, what can you do? Recent Gradle releases give you new capabilities to greatly improve your build speed. This session discusses how you can : \r\n\r\n- Identify performance bottlenecks with build scans \r\n- Fix common problems, like slow configuration time, tasks running when they shouldn’t, and builds that don’t parallelize well\r\n- Benefit from incremental annotation processing"
