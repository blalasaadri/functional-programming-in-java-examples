Your personal life is even worse. This has happened to us too. But we have found techniques to get back in control. And we would like to share what we have learned. We are not gurus nor productivity experts, but like you information age professionals and hackers. We just hacked our life.\r\n\r\nGetting Things Done, Personal Kanban, Inbox Zero, these techniques all share a common foundation. Let’s use this lab to let you experience what these techniques are about, and maybe your first step towards a more zen organized life."

When the community all share our charts, the Kubernetes community at large learns how best to work with Kubernetes. We share information and discover great ways of doing things. And we also make it easier for newcomers to get going. Helm is about growing Kubernetes.</p>\n<p>Second, Helm wants to make it easier for teams to manage their Kubernetes manifest files. The Helm community created a tool that eases the process of collaborating on and keeping track of your team's charts. Start with widely available charts, customize them to your team's needs, and then store them in your own version control. Helm is about helping teams.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes is a powerful platform.

When the community all share our charts, the Kubernetes community at large learns how best to work with Kubernetes. We share information and discover great ways of doing things. And we also make it easier for newcomers to get going. Helm is about growing Kubernetes.\r\n\r\nSecond, Helm wants to make it easier for teams to manage their Kubernetes manifest files. The Helm community created a tool that eases the process of collaborating on and keeping track of your team's charts. Start with widely available charts, customize them to your team's needs, and then store them in your own version control. Helm is about helping teams.\r\n\r\nKubernetes is a powerful platform.

In this session we will discuss how Google Vision API, existing face recognition models and Tensorflow-Keras can be used together to group the pictures of the speakers in the Devoxx Flickr albums. \r\n\r\nAs a last year student in Applied Informatics, Lien will focus on the usability and application of existing frameworks to build a production-ready solution in the Cloud. Alex will explain the role of a mentor in order to complete a project successfully.\r\n\r\nJan Kees will discuss how he used the API to visualize this on the website."
